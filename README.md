First Mission 0 for Lvl 5

## Show Code 1st

### 1. What was used to create the website

#### a. Bootstrap

- Created Navbar. Used the bootstrap website to create the Nav, used the “collapse navbar-collapse justify-content-end” to spread the nav-link out to the right.
- With the search bar I basically created 2 of them, one being the desktop version, and the other for mobile (line 108 to 113) for mobile and line 139 to 140 for desktop.
- The Carousel cycles a few images and one video, the video I've used was basically downloaded off Youtube. Although not needed for the mission, I had time to burn to try and render the video into the html
- With the “Main Content” I created the cards kinda similar to the wireframe showing at the Mission objective. Again with enough time I created a few more than I needed to. But the idea was to have the cards related to the images showing on the carousel.
- With more of the styling involved. Used both Bootstrap CSS and internal style CSS in the webpage. I personally don’t like the idea of internal/inline CSS, as I like to keep things separate. But after going through the NavBar, search and Carousel. In the end I had to try and save time altogether.
- I kind of had to use the scripts externally, this was only used to skip a part of the video and keep the engagement just to rope the audience in. From line 114 to line 120, 1st I had to download the youtube video as embedding doesn’t seem to work from the youtube source.

#### b. Responsive

- For the cards, I used the grid system to layout 3 rows at the bottom of my website. Initially it was 3. But slowly added 3 more rows under the initial cards. This was just as simple a little bit of copy-pasting for the additional teams and information used inside cards.

### 2. Challenges

- One of the biggest challenges was definitely finding the way to turn all that content in the page into responsiveness for mobile. Thought about leaving it to the side. But now it’s a must to get used making websites for mobiles. So finding time to train and apply was a bit of a hurdle.
- The other hurdle was my flexibility of the mission. There were a couple of times where I had to start again only because I had big roadblocks on my way to finish my mission. One example was when I trying to code in react. Then I decided to give an API a go to render my teams in, only not work. I got so confused in the end, and time was ticking.
- After this presentation, I might remove the video. Only because the file size is pretty big.

### 3. Show video unmuted. Until chorus is done then apply mute.
